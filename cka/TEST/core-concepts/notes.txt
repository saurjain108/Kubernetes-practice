 For example, suppose you have a set of Pods that each listen on TCP port 9376 and carry a label app=MyApp. This specification creates a new Service object named “my-service”, which targets TCP port 9376 on any Pod with the app=MyApp label.
Sometimes you don’t need load-balancing and a single Service IP. In this case, you can create what are termed “headless” Services, by explicitly specifying None for the cluster IP (.spec.clusterIP)
