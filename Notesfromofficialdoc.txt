1. With multiple-zone clusters, this spreading behavior is extended across zones (to reduce the impact of zone failures.) (This is achieved via SelectorSpreadPriority)

And "VolumeZonePredicate" predicate) will then ensure that pods that claim a given volume are only placed into the same zone as that volume, as volumes cannot be attached across zones.

3. Volume zone-affinity will only work with a "PersistentVolume", and will not work if you directly specify an EBS volume
